# Ratatui.cs Documentation Hub

Welcome. This hub links out to the small, focused docs you’ll likely need when building fast, reliable TUIs with Ratatui.cs. Each page is short, pragmatic, and includes pointers back to related topics.

- Start here: ergonomics and performance — see csharp-ergonomics.md
- Batch marshaling (spans/lines/rows) — see batching-and-spans.md
- Headless snapshots and style/cell dumps — see headless-testing.md
- Terminal RAII + App runners — see terminal-and-app.md
- Widgets quick guide (Table/Tabs/Chart/Scrollbar/Canvas/LineGauge) — see widgets.md
- FFI coverage, suggestions, and stub generation — see ffi-coverage-and-stubs.md

If you’re working across languages (C#, Python, TypeScript), see bindings-update-playbook.md for an end‑to‑end parity and validation playbook.
